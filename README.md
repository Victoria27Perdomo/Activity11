## ACTIVITY 11

1.	A primary view containing a menu with at least three options (you can put any options you want, for example, "home, photos, contact" or "home, income, expenses, reports".
2.	You will create a view for each menu option, the content for each section must be different, and it must be clear that the view corresponds to the section.
3.	Each time a view is accessed, you must highlight the section in the main menu; for example, if "home, photos, contact" is selected in the menu, when accessing the "contact" section, the menu must highlight the contact option ("home, photos, contact").
4.	You must create a footer with information about who is performing the activity. The footer should be displayed from all views (as a recommendation, insert it in the primary view).
5.	Create the project in git and upload your activity to GitHub. Remember to edit your README.md file with information about the activity. Don't forget that for the views to work, you must create their routes and/or controller(s) that will resolve the routes.
